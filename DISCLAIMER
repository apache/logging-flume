Apache Flume is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator Project Management
Committee.

Incubation is required for all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decisions making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
