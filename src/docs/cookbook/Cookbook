== Introduction

Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log
data.  Being highly configurable and very extensible means that there
are many options and thus many decisions that need to be made by an
operator.  This document is a "cookbook" with "recipes" for getting
Flume up and running quickly without being overwhelmed with all the
details.

This document starts with some basic tips on experimenting with Flume
nodes, and then three stories about setting up agents for different
kinds of sources.  Finally we'll do a quick setup for collectors and
how to troubleshoot distributed deployments.

* Basic debugging with one-shot Flume nodes
* Flume agents for Apache web server logging
* Flume agents for syslog / syslog-ng logging
* Flume agents for scribe logging
// * Flume agents for logging via log4j
// * Configuring nodes on node startup
// * Small Deployments.
