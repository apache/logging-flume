== Logging Scribe Events to a Flume Agent

Flume can emulate a downstream node for applications that log using
Scribe.  Scribe is Facebook's open source log aggregation framework.
It has a simple API and uses Thrift as its core network transport
mechanism.  Flume uses the same Thrift IDL file and can listen for
data provided by Scribe sources.

Scribe comes with an example application called +scribe_cat+.  It acts
like the unix +cat+ program but sends data to a downstream host with a
specified "category".  Scribe by default uses TCP port 1463.

You can configure a Flume node to listen for incoming Scribe traffic
by creating a logical node that uses the +scribe+ source.  We can then
assign an arbitrary sink to the node.  In the example below, the
Scribe nodes recives events, send its events to both the console and
an automically-assigned end-to-end agent which delivers the events
downstream to its collector pools.

----
scribe: scribe | [console, autoE2EChain];
----

Assuming that this node communicates with the master, and that the
node is on +localhost+, we can use the +scribe_cat+ program to send
data to Flume.

----
$ echo "foo" | scribe_cat localhost testcategory
----

When the Scribe source accepts the Scribe events, it converts Scribe's
category information into a new Flume event metadata entry, and then
delivers the event to its sinks.  Since Scribe does not include time
metadata, the timestamp of the created Flume event will be the arrival
time of the Scribe event.
