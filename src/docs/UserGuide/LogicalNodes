
=== Logical Configurations

Manually configuring nodes in Flume is manageable for a small number of nodes, 
but can become burdensome for an operator as demands inevitably grow.  
Ideally, the operator only has to assign a role to a particular machine.  
Because configuration management is centralized via the Master, the Master 
potentially has all the information necessary to intelligently create a node 
topology and isolate flows of data from each other.

To explain how this can be done, the concept of a *logical node* is 
introduced. To manage communications between logical nodes, the concepts of 
*logical sources* and *logical sinks* are introduced.  To isolate different 
groups of nodes, the concept of a *flow* is introduced that allows you to 
group agents and collectors into separate and isolated groups.

==== Logical Nodes

The logical node abstraction allows for each JVM instance (a physical node) to 
contain multiple logical nodes.  This allows for the processing of many source 
sink combinations on many threads of execution to occur on a single JVM 
instance.

Each logical node has a name that may be completely different from its 
physical name or hostname.  You now need new operations that enable you to 
spawn a new node, map logical nodes to physical nodes, and decommission 
existing logical nodes.

NOTE: The following commands are entered via the web interface using the "raw 
command" web page on the Master.  You might prefer using the Flume command 
shell (described in a later section) for these operations.  The same commands 
described in this section can be entered in web interface or entered at the 
command shell by prefixing the command with 'exec'.

Suppose that initially you know you want an agent-collector topology, but you 
don’t know the particular names of the exact machines.  For now, you can 
specify the configuration of the logical nodes without specifying any physical 
machine names.

----
agent1 : _source_ | autoBEChain ; 
collector1 : collectorSource | collectorSink("hdfs://....") ; 
----

Later you learn that host1 is the name of the agent1 machine and host2 is the 
name of the collector machine.  You can 'spawn' logical nodes onto the 
physical Flume instances on host1 and host2 by issuing the following spawn 
commands:

----
spawn host1 agent1 
spawn host2 collector1
----

Afterwards, the node status table should display a new row of information for 
each logical node.  Each logical node reports its own execution state, 
configuration, and heartbeat.  There is also a new entry in the logical node 
mapping table showing that the logical node has been placed on the specified 
physical node. To configure the node's sources and sinks, use exactly the same 
mechanisms described in the previous sections.

You can also remove a logical node by using the 'decommission' command. 
Suppose you no longer needed agent1 and wanted to "turn it off".  You can do 
so by entering the following command:

----
decomission agent1
----

This terminates the thread and removes the configuration associated with a 
logical node, and the mapping between the logical node and physical node.

You can also move a logical node from one physical node to another by first 
unmapping a logical node and then spawning it on another physical node.  In 
this scenario, you change the collector1 from being on host2 to host3.  

----
unmap host2 collector1
----

At this point, the logical node mapping is removed, and colletor1 is not 
active anywhere. You can then map collector1 onto host3 by using the spawn 
command:

----
spawn host3 colletor1
----

NOTE: There are some limitations that need to be further described in this 
section.

==== Logical Sources and Logical Sinks

In the previous example, we used two abstractions under-the-covers that allow 
the specifications of a graph topology for communications 'without having to 
use physical hostnames and ports'. These abstractions -- the *logical source* 
and *logical sink* -- allow you to create a different graph topology without 
having to know physical machines until they are mapped.

Suppose you have two nodes producing data and sending it to the consumer:

----
dataProducer1 : console | logicalSink("dataConsumer") ;
dataProducer2 : console | logicalSink("dataConsumer") ;
dataConsumer : logicalSource | console ;
----

Note that in this example, the destination argument is the *logical name* of 
the node and not a specific host/port combination.

To implement these features, there is a generalized mechanism where users 
enter logical configurations that are 'translated' by the Master to a physical 
configuration.

When the logical nodes get mapped to physical nodes:

----
spawn host1 dataProducer1
spawn host2 dataProducer2
spawn host3 dataConsumer
----

and after the Master learns the host names (the host1, host2, and host3 
machine’s heartbeat against the Master), the Master has enough information to 
translate configurations with physical hostnames and ports.  A possible 
translation would replace the logicalSource with a rpcSources and the 
logicalSink with an rpcSinks:

----
dataProducer1 : console | rpcSink("host3",56789) ;
dataProducer2 : console | rpcSink("host3",56789) ;
dataConsumer : rpcSource(56789) | console ;
----

In fact, auto agents and collectors, are another example of *translated 
sources and sinks*.  These translate auto*Chain sinks and collectorSource into 
a configuration that uses logicalSinks and logicalSources which in turn are 
translated into phsyical rpcSource and rpcSinks instances.

TIP: Translations are powerful and can be fairly smart; if new collectors are 
added, they will become new failover options.  If collectors are removed, then 
the removed collectors will be automatically replaced by other failover nodes.


==== Flow Isolation

What happens if you want collect different kinds of data from the same 
physical node?  For example, suppose you wanted to collect httpd logs as well 
as syslog logs from the same physical machine.  Suppose also you want to write 
all of the syslog data from the cluster in one directory tree, and all of the 
httpd logs from the cluster in another.

One approach is to tag all the data with source information and then push all 
the data down the same pipe.  This could then be followed by some post-
processing that demultiplexes (demuxes) the data into different buckets.  
Another approach is to keep the two sets of data logically isolated from each 
other the entire time and avoid post processing.

Flume can do both approaches but enables the latter lower-latency
approach, by introducing the concept of grouping nodes into
*flows*. Since there are logical nodes that allow for multiple nodes
on a single JVM, you can have a node for each different kinds of
produced data.

The following example shows how flows can be used. Start by having six logical 
nodes in the system.

----
fooNode1 : fooSrc | autoBEChain ;
barNode1 : barSrc | autoBEChain ;
forNode2 : fooSrc | autoBEChain ;
barNode2 : barSrc | autoBEChain ; 
fooConsumer : collectorSource | collectorSink("hdfs://nn/foodir") ;
barConsumer : collectorSource | collectorSink("hdfs://nn/bardir") ;
----

In the scenario, there are two physical machines that produce both kinds of 
data -- foo data and bar data. You want to send data to single collector that 
collects both foo data and bar data and writes it to different HDFS 
directories.  You could then spawn the nodes onto physical nodes:

----
spawn host1 fooNode1
spawn host1 barNode1
spawn host2 fooNode2
spawn host2 barNode2
spawn host3 fooConsumer
spawn host3 barConsumer
----

.Flume Flows: Single Flow
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph single_flow {
  label="A single flume flow";
  rankdir=LR;  

  node [shape=record];
  HDFS;

  node [shape=Mrecord]
  edge [style="bold", weight=10]
  fooNode1 -> fooConsumer -> HDFS;
  fooNode1 -> barConsumer -> HDFS;
  fooNode2 -> fooConsumer;
  fooNode2 -> barConsumer;
  barNode1 -> fooConsumer;
  barNode1 -> barConsumer;
  barNode2 -> fooConsumer;
  barNode2 -> barConsumer;

  subgraph cluster_host1 { label="host1"; fooNode1; barNode1; }
  subgraph cluster_host2 { label="host2"; fooNode2; barNode2; }
  subgraph cluster_host3 { label="host3"; fooConsumer; barConsumer }

  node [shape=none]
  "agent tier" -> "collector tier" -> "storage tier"
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------


This setup essentially instantiates the first approach.  It mixes foo and bar 
data together since the translation of autoBEChain would see two 
collectorSources that the Master considers to be equivalent.  Foo data will 
likely be sent to the barConsumer and bar data will likely be sent to 
fooConsumer.

You really wanted to separate sources of information into logically isolated 
streams of data.  Flume provides a grouping abstraction called a *flow*.  A 
flow groups particular logical nodes together so that the different logical 
data types remain isolated.

More concretely, it allows for a different failover chain for each kind of 
data in the Flume cluster.  The auto*Chain based agents would only send data 
to collectors in the same flow group.  This isolates data so that it only 
flows to nodes within the group.

You specify flow groups by adding an extra parameter to the spawn command:

----
spawn host1 fooNode1 flowfoo
spawn host1 barNode1 flowbar
spawn host2 fooNode2 flowfoo
spawn host2 barNode2 flowbar
spawn host3 fooConsumer flowfoo
spawn host3 barConsumer flowbar
----


["graphviz", "multi-flow.png"]
.Flume Flows: Multiple Flows
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph multi_flow {
  label="Multiple isolated flume flows";
  rankdir=LR;  

  node [shape=record];
  HDFS;


  node [shape=Mrecord]
  edge [style="bold", weight=10]
  fooNode1 -> fooConsumer -> HDFS;
  fooNode2 -> fooConsumer;
  barNode1 -> barConsumer -> HDFS;
  barNode2 -> barConsumer;

  subgraph cluster_host1 { label="host1"; fooNode1; barNode1; }
  subgraph cluster_host2 { label="host2"; fooNode2; barNode2; }
  subgraph cluster_host3 { label="host3"; fooConsumer; barConsumer }

  node [shape=none]
  "agent tier" -> "collector tier" -> "storage tier"

}
---------------------------------------------------------------------



By using this command, the data from fooNode1 and fooNode2 will only be sent 
to fooConsumer, and barNode1 and barNode2's data will only be sent to 
barConsumer.  Data from one node is not mixed with other data from other 
nodes unless explicitly connected.

TIP: In practice it is a good idea to use different node names and different 
flow ids for different kinds of data.  When node names are reused, the default 
behavior is to attempt to recover from failures assuming that leftover data 
from a crashed execution or previous source/sink configuration version are 
still producing the same kind of data.

==== Section Summary

This section introduced logical nodes, logical sources, logical sinks, and 
flows and showed how these abstractions enable you to automatically deal with 
manageability problems.

* Only one input source per physical node.  
* Multiple sets of isolated flows.  
* Being machine specific, having to know all physical host names and ports.

The translation mechanism can be quite powerful.  When coupled with
metrics information, this could be used to perform automated dynamic
configuration changes.  A possible example would be to automatically
commission or decommission new collectors to match diurnal traffic and
load patterns.
