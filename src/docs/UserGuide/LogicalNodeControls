=== Logical Nodes: Multiple nodes in on a single JVM

So far, we have talked about a simple setup where one data flow
corresponds to on JVM instance and one machine.  We may want to have
multple data flow nodes in a single JVM, each with a different data
flow specification.  For example, we may want a separate logical node
that sends aggregate reporting information about the node to a
separate analytics node. Enabling this requires a little bit of new
terminology and the addition of some new API calls.

We call each JVM running an instance of the node program a *physical
node*.  Each of the data flows running on a physical node is called a
*logical node*.  Each JVM instance of the node program has a name
which is by default the `hostname` of the machine.  We call this the
*physical node name*.  Each physical node by default starts one
logical node.  This is by default has the same name as the physical
node.  We call this name the *logical node name*.

NOTE: If we just use *node*, instead of physical node or node program,
we mean a logical node.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph single_logical_physical { 
  rankdir=LR;
  node[shape=record];

 // need to name with "cluster" for grouping
  subgraph cluster_A {  label="nodeA"; nodeA; }
  subgraph cluster_B {  label="nodeB"; nodeB; }

  nodeA -> nodeB -> HDFS;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As an example, in the picture above we expose a little more detail
with the simple single logical to physical node mapping.  Here we have
a physical node called "nodeA" (the outer container) which has a
logical node named "nodeA", and a physical "nodeB" with logical
"nodeB".

The master now must maintain a new table that tracks each mapping from
a physical node to a set of logical nodes.  We call this the *virtual
node table* This information must be persistent -- if a physical node
goes down we want it to come back up, retrieve its logical nodes list
and restore their configuraitons.  Below is a representation of the
mapping from the graph above:

[grid="all"]
`-------------`----------------
Physical Node Logical Nodes
+nodeA+	      +nodeA+
+nodeB+	      +nodeB+
----------------------------

==== map

Users can control the mappings to this table by issuing commands to
the master.  By using the +map+ command (found the raw command
form), a new logical node is associated with a physical node.  Map
takes two arguments: a phyiscal node name and a new logical node name;
and updates the master physical node mapping table.  When a node
heartbeats, it finds out the list of nodes it is expected to have
instantiated.  If a logical node is not present on the physical node,
the physical node instantiates a new logical node in the node program.

So, lets map some logical nodes!

----
map nodeA nodeAreport
map nodeA foo
map nodeB nodeBreport
----

The updated virtual node table should look like 
[grid="all"]
`-------------`------------------------------
Physical Node Logical Nodes
+nodeA+	      +nodeA+, +nodeAreport+, +foo+
+nodeB+	      +nodeB+, +nodeBreport+
---------------------------------------------

["graphviz", "multiplelogical1.png"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph multiple_logical_node { 
  rankdir=LR;
  node[shape=record];

 // need to name with "cluster" for grouping
  subgraph cluster_A {  label="nodeA"; nodeA; nodeAreports; foo; }
  subgraph cluster_B {  label="nodeB"; nodeB; nodeBreports; }

  nodeA -> nodeB -> HDFS;
 }
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Great! We now have new logical nodes instantiated on the physical
nodes.  But wait, all the nodes are in IDLE mode!  Just adding a new
physical-logical node mapping does not guarentee that the logical node
a configuration.  A user still must assign a data flow to the logical
node name.

Let's configure some of these nodes to have a sink that sends report
data to another node called +reports+.

["graphviz", "multiplelogical2.png"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph multiple_logical_node { 
  rankdir=LR;
  node[shape=record];

 // need to name with "cluster" for grouping
  subgraph cluster_A {  label="nodeA"; nodeA; nodeAreports; foo; }
  subgraph cluster_B {  label="nodeB"; nodeB; nodeBreports; }

  nodeA -> nodeB -> HDFS;
  nodeAreports -> reports;
  nodeBreports -> reports;
 }
---------------------------------------------------------------------


==== decommission

Users can decommission a logical node by using the +decommission+
command.  It takes one argument: the logical node name.  If the
logical node name is present, it is removed from the data flow node
table.  The virtual node mapping is also removed.  Because the logical
node is no longer present, if a physical node heartbeats and gets a
logical node list that does not specify a node currently instantiated,
it shuts down those particular logical nodes.

So, when we decommission +nodeAreports+,

----
decomission nodeAreports
----

our virtual node mapping looks like this.

[grid="all"]
`-------------`------------------------------
Physical Node Logical Nodes
+nodeA+	      +nodeA+, +foo+
+nodeB+	      +nodeB+, +nodeBreport+
---------------------------------------------

["graphviz", "multiplelogical3.png"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph multiple_logical_node { 
  rankdir=LR;
  node[shape=record];

 // need to name with "cluster" for grouping
  subgraph cluster_A {  label="nodeA"; nodeA;  foo; }
  subgraph cluster_B {  label="nodeB"; nodeB; nodeBreports; }

  nodeA -> nodeB -> HDFS;
  nodeBreports -> reports;
 }
---------------------------------------------------------------------

==== unmap

Finally, users can also use the +unmap+ command.  This takes two
arguments -- a physical node name and a logical node name -- and only
removes the physical-logical node mapping from the master.  Because
the logical node is not present for that particular physical node, the
original physical node will decommission the logical node.  This can
be used to "move" a logical node from one machine to another by
subsequently using the +map+ command with a different physical node
arguement.

----
unmap nodeA foo
----

[grid="all"]
`-------------`------------------------------
Physical Node Logical Nodes
+nodeA+	      +nodeA+ 
+nodeB+	      +nodeB+, +nodeBreport+
---------------------------------------------

["graphviz", "multiplelogical4.png"]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph multiple_logical_node { 
  rankdir=LR;
  node[shape=record];

 // need to name with "cluster" for grouping
  subgraph cluster_A {  label="nodeA"; nodeA;    }
  subgraph cluster_B {  label="nodeB"; nodeB; nodeBreports;  }

  nodeA -> nodeB -> HDFS;
  nodeBreports -> reports;
 }
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We can then map foo onto nodeB:

----
map nodeB foo
----

and the same configuration that used to be on +nodeA+ will be
instantiated on +nodeB+.


Curently the primary use case for logical nodes is to add extra
metrics reporting data flows.  We are currently working on makign the
WAL and DFO sharable by all of the logical nodes on a physcal
node.

  subgraph cluster_B {  label="nodeB"; nodeB; nodeBreports; foo; }

  nodeA -> nodeB -> HDFS;
  nodeBreports -> reports;
 }
