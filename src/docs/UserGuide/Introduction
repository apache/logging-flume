[[Introduction]]
== Introduction

Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for
efficiently moving large amounts of data soon after the data is
produced.  This release provides a scalable conduit to shipping data
around a cluster as well as reliable logging.

The primary use case for Flume is as a logging system that gathers a
set of log files on every machine in a cluster and aggregates them to
a centralized persistent store such as the Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS).  

The system was designed with these four key goals in mind:

* Reliability 
* Scalability 
* Manageability 
* Extensibility

This section provides a high-level overview of Flume's architecture
and describes how the four design goals are achieved.

=== Architecture

Flume's architecture is simple, robust, and flexible.  The main
abstraction in Flume is a stream-oriented *data flow*.  A data flow
describes the way a single stream of data is transferred and processed
from its point of generation to its eventual destination. Data flows
are composed of *logical nodes* that can transform or aggregate the
events they receive.  Logical nodes are wired together in chains to
form a data flow. The way in which they are wired is called the
logical node's *configuration*.

Controlling all this is the *Flume Master*, which is a separate
service with knowledge of all the physical and logical nodes in a
Flume installation. The Master assigns configurations to logical
nodes, and is responsible for communicating configuration updates by
the user to all logical nodes.  In turn, the logical nodes
periodically contact the master so they can share monitoring
information and check for updates to their configuration.

// I think this should just use node here and introduce logical nodes
// and physical nodes later

The graph above shows a typical deployment of Flume that collects log
data from a set of application servers.  The deployment consists of a
number of _logical nodes_, arranged into three tiers. The first tier
is the _agent_ tier.  Agent nodes are typically installed on the
machines that generate the logs and are your data's initial point of
contact with Flume.  They forward data to the next tier of _collector
nodes_, which aggregate the separate data flows and forward them to
the final _storage tier_.

For example, the agents could be machines listening for +syslog+ data
or monitoring the logs of a service such as a web server or the Hadoop
JobTracker. The agents produce streams of data that are sent to the
collectors; the collectors then aggregate the streams into larger
streams which can be written efficiently to a storage tier such as
HDFS.

Logical nodes are a very flexible abstraction. Every logical node has
just two components - a _source_ and a _sink_. The source tells a
logical node where to collect data, and the sink tells it where to
send the data. The only difference between two logical nodes is how
the source and sink are configured. Both source and sink can
additionally be configured with _decorators_ which perform some simple
processing on data as it passes through. In the previous example, the
collector and the agents are _running the same node software_.  The
Master assigns a configuration to each logical node at run-time - all
components of a node's configuration are instantiated dynamically at
run-time, and therefore configurations can be changed many times
throughout the lifetime of a Flume service without having to restart
any Java processes or log into the machines themselves. In fact,
logical nodes themselves can be created and deleted dynamically.


The source, sink, and optional decorators are a powerful set of
primitives. Flume uses this architecture to provide per-flow data
properties (for example durability guarantees, compression, or
batching), or to compute event metadata, or even generate new events
that are inserted into data flow.  A logical node can also send data
downstream to several logical nodes.  This allows for multiple flows
and each subflow can potentially be configured differently.  For
example, it’s possible to have one flow be a collection path,
delivering data reliably to a persistent store, while another branch
computes lightweight analytics to be delivered to an alerting system.

// I think this box is too early.

.Logical and Physical Nodes
***********************
It's important to make the distinction between _logical nodes_ and
_physical nodes_. A physical node corresponds to a single Java process
running on one machine in a single JVM instance. Usually there is just
one physical node per machine. Physical nodes act as containers for
_logical nodes_, which are wired together to form data flows. Each
physical node can play host to many logical nodes, and takes care of
arbitrating the assignment of machine resources between them. So,
although the agents and the collectors in the preceding example are
_logically_ separate processes, they could be running on the same
_physical_ node. Flume gives users the flexibility to specify where
the computation and data transfer are done. The remainder of this
guide describes logical nodes unless stated otherwise.
***********************

=== Reliability

Reliability, the ability to continue delivering events in the face of
failures without losing data, is a vital feature of Flume. Large
distributed systems can and do suffer partial failures in many ways -
physical hardware can fail, resources such as network bandwidth or
memory can become scarce, or software can crash or run slowly. Flume
emphasizes fault-tolerance as a core design principle and keeps
running and collecting data even when many components have failed.

Flume can guarantee that all data received by an agent node will
eventually make it to the collector at the end of its flow as long as
the agent node keeps running.  That is, data can be *reliably*
delivered to its eventual destination.

However, reliable delivery can be very resource intensive and is often
a stronger guarantee than some data sources require. Therefore, Flume
allows the user to specify, on a per-flow basis, the level of
reliability required. There are three supported reliability levels:

* End-to-end
* Store on failure 
* Best effort

.A Note About Reliability
******************
Although Flume is extremely tolerant to machine, network, and software
failures, there is never any such thing as '100% reliability'. If all
the machines in a Flume installation were irrevocably destroyed in
some terrible data center incident, all copies of Flume's data would
be lost and there would be no way to recover them. Therefore all of
Flume's reliability levels make guarantees about data delivery 'until
some maximum number of failures have occurred'. Flume's failure modes
- in terms of what can fail and what will keep running if they do -
are described in detail later in this guide.
******************

The *end-to-end* reliability level guarantees that once Flume accepts
an event, that event will make it to the endpoint - as long as the
agent that accepted the event remains live long enough. The first
thing the agent does in this setting is write the event to disk in a
''write-ahead log'' (WAL) so that, if the agent crashes and restarts,
knowledge of the event is not lost. After the event has successfully
made its way to the end of its flow, an acknowledgment is sent back to
the originating agent so that it knows it no longer needs to store the
event on disk. This reliability level can withstand any number of
failures downstream of the initial agent.

The *store on failure* reliability level causes nodes to only require
an acknowledgement from the node one hop downstream.  If the sending
node detects a failure, it will store data on its local disk until the
downstream node is repaired, or an alternate downstream destination
can be selected.  While this is effective, data can be lost if a
compound or silent failure occurs.

The *best-effort* reliability level sends data to the next hop with no
attempts to confirm or retry delivery.  If nodes fail, any data that
they were in the process of transmitting or receiving can be
lost. This is the weakest reliability level, but also the most
lightweight.

.Eliminating Single Points of Failure
************************
Even when using the end-to-end reliability level, a Flume flow can
fail to make progress if there aren't any nodes available to process
events. The data will continue to be collected by the agents, but the
agents may not be able to deliver the data downstream until a suitable
node comes online. In order to maintain high availability, Flume
allows flows to fail over from one downstream node to another without
any user intervention. The Flume Master can also be replicated for
high availability which means that both the data plane and the control
plane can tolerate a number of faults.
************************

=== Scalability 

Scalability is the ability to increase system performance linearly -
or better - by adding more resources to the system.  Flume's goal is
horizontal scalability -- the ability to incrementally add more
machines to the system to increase throughput. A key performance
measure in Flume is the number or size of events entering the system
and being delivered.  When load increases, it is simple to add more
resources to the system in the form of more machines to handle the
increased load.

As seen in the preceding example installation, there are three
separate components of Flume that require different approaches to
scalability: the collector tier, the master, and the storage tier.

The collector tier needs to be able to scale in order to handle large
volumes of data coming from large numbers of agent nodes.  This
workload is write heavy, partitionable, and thus parallelizable.  By
adding more machines to the collector tier, you can increase the
number of agents and the maximum available throughput of the system.

An individual collector can usually handle many agents (up to
hundreds) because each individual agent often produces only small
amounts of log data compared to the full bandwidth available to the
collector. Therefore, Flume balances flows from agents across
different collectors. (One flow from an agent will talk to the same
collector.) Flume uses a randomized algorithm to evenly assign lists
of collectors to flows.  This automatically spreads the load, and also
keeps the load spread in the case where a collector fails.

As the number of nodes in the system increases, the volume of traffic
on the control path to and from the Flume Master may become a
bottleneck. The Flume Master also supports horizontal scaling by
adding more machines - although just a small number of commodity
servers can serve a large installation of nodes. The state of the
Flume Master is kept synchronized and fully replicated, which ensures
that it is both fault tolerant and highly scalable.

Finally, Flume can only write data through a flow at the rate that the
final destinations can accept. Although Flume is able to buffer data
inside a flow to smooth out high-volume bursts, the output rate needs
to be equal on average to the input rate to avoid log jams. Thus,
writing to a scalable storage tier is advisable.  For example, HDFS
has been shown to scale to thousands of machines and can handle many
petabytes of data.

=== Manageability

Manageability is the ability to control data flows, monitor nodes,
modify settings, and control outputs of a large system.  Manually
managing the data flow from the sources to the end point is tedious,
error prone, and a major pain point.  With the potential to have
thousands of log-generating applications and services, it's important
to have a centralized management point to monitor and change data
flows, and the ability to dynamically handle different conditions or
problems.

The Flume Master is the point where global state such as the data
flows can be managed. Via the Flume Master, users can monitor flows
and reconfigure them on the fly.  The Flume Master has the information
required to automatically respond to system changes such as load
imbalances, partial failures, or newly provisioned hardware.

You can dynamically reconfigure nodes by using the Flume Master.
Although this guide describes examples of traditional three-tier
deployments, the flexibility of the nodes allow for arbitrary node
topologies.  You can reconfigure nodes by using small scripts written
in a flexible dataflow specification language, which can be submitted
via the Flume Master interface.

You can administer the Flume Master by using either of two interfaces:
a web interface or the scriptable Flume command shell.  The web
interface provides interactive updates of the system’s state.  The
shell enables administration via manually crafted scripts or
machine-generated scripts.

=== Extensibility

Extensibility is the ability to add new functionality to a system. For
example, you can extend Flume by adding connectors to existing storage
layers or data platforms.  This is made possible by simple interfaces,
separation of functional concerns into simple composable pieces, a
flow specification language, and a simple but flexible data model.

Flume provides many common input and output connectors.  When new
input connectors (sources) are added, extra metadata fields specific
to that source can be attached to each event it produces.  Flume
reuses the common components that provide particular reliability and
resource usage properties.  Some general sources include files from
the file system, syslog and syslog-ng emulation, or the standard
output of a process.  More specific sources such as IRC channels and
Twitter streams can also be added.  Similarly, there are many output
destinations for events.  Although HDFS is the primary output
destination, events can be sent to local files, or to monitoring and
alerting applications such as Ganglia or communication channels such
as IRC.

To enable easy integration with HDFS, MapReduce, and Hive, Flume
provides simple mechanisms for output file management and output
format management.  Data gathered by Flume can be processed easily
with Hadoop and Hive.
