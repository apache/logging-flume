=== The Flume Command Shell

So far, you have been modifying the state of Flume using a simple (but 
primitive) web interface to a Master server.  

Flume also provides a shell, which allows the user to type commands into a 
terminal and have them executed on a Flume deployment.

All of the commands available in the web form are available in the
Flume Shell.  The Flume Shell, however, actually has extra controls
for command submission control and state checking that aid
scriptability.

==== Using the Flume Command Shell

You can start the FlumeShell by running +flume shell+ in a terminal window. 
The +connect+ command can be used to establish a connection to any Master 
server.

----
hostname:~/flume$ flume shell
[flume (disconnected)] connect localhost:35873
Connecting to Flume master localhost:35873...
[flume localhost:35873]
----

----
hostname:~/flume$ flume shell -c localhost:35873
Connecting to Flume master localhost:35873...
[flume localhost:35873]
----

******
The port to use is the value of +flume.config.admin.port+ and defaults to 35873. 
******

The command line parameters for the Flume Shell are as follows:

----
usage: FlumeShell [-c <arg>] [-e <arg>] [-q] [-s <arg>]
 -?         Command line usage help
 -c <arg>   Connect to master:port
 -e <arg>   Run a single command
 -q         Run in quiet mode - only print command results
 -s <arg>   Run a FlumeShell script
----

The FlumeShell makes scripting Flume possible - either by using a single 
invocation with +-e+ or by running a script of commands with +-s+. It is also 
possible to pipe +stdin+ to the FlumeShell as in the following example:

----
echo "connect localhost:35873\ngetconfigs\nquit" | flume shell -q
----

.Flume Commands

You can press Tab any time for some hints on available commands.  If you start 
typing a command you can use TAB to complete command.

+help+ :: List the commands available in the shell.

+connect _master:port_+ :: connect to a master at machine _master_ on port 
_port_.

+config+ _logicalnode_ _source_ _sink_ :: configure a single logical node 
_logicalnode_ with source _source_ and sink _sink_.  _source_ and _sink_ will 
likely need quotes to support some of the Flume configuration syntax.

+getnodestatus+ :: Output the status of the nodes the master knows
about. Nodes are in either HELLO, CONFIGURING, ACTIVE, IDLE, ERROR,
DECOMMISSIONED, or LOST states.  When a node shows up initially it is
HELLO state.  When a node is being configured, it is in CONFIGURING
state.  Once events are being pumped from source to sink, the node is
in ACTIVE state.  If a node has drained its source (and the source is
not "endless") it will enter IDLE state.  If a node encountered an
unrecoverable error or exited without flushing, it will be in ERROR
state.  A node is DECOMMISSIONED if it is removed on the master, and
LOST if it has not been seen by the master for a "long time".

+getconfigs+ :: This gets and dumps the configuration specifications of all 
the logical nodes the master knows about.

+getmappings [_physical node_]+ :: Display all logical nodes mapped to
_physical node_ or all mappings if _physical node_ is omitted.

+exec+ :: Synchronously execute a command on the master.  This command will 
block until it is completed.

+source _file_+ :: Reads the specified file and attempts to execute all of the 
specified commands.

+submit+ :: Asynchronously execute a command on the master.  This command will 
return immediately and allows the submission of other commands.  The command 
ID of the last command submitted is recorded.

+wait _ms_ [_cmdid_]+ :: This commands blocks for up to +ms+ milliseconds 
until +cmdid+ has entered the SUCCEEDED or FAILED state. If +ms+ is 0 the 
command may block forever.  If the command times out, the shell will 
disconnect.  This is useful in conjunction with +submitted+ commands.

+waitForNodesActive _ms_ node1 [node2 [...]]+ :: This command blocks for up to 
+ms+ milliseconds until the specified list of nodes have entered the ACTIVE or 
CONFIGURING state.  If ms==0 then the command may block forever.

+waitForNodesDone _ms_ node1 [node2 [...]]+ :: This command blocks for up to 
+ms+ milliseconds until the specified list of nodes have entered the IDLE, 
ERROR, or LOST state.

+quit+ :: Exit the shell.

.Exec and Submit commands

Both the web form and the FlumeShell are interfaces to the same command 
processing infrastructure inside Flume. This section introduces the 
FlumeShell and show how you can use it to make administering Flume more 
simple.

These commands are issued and run as if run from the master.  In the command 
shell they have the form:

+exec _command_ [_arg1 [_arg2_ [ ... ] ] ]+

+submit _command_ [_arg1 [_arg2_ [ ... ] ] ]+

Complex arguments like those with spaces, or non alpha-numeric characters can 
be expressed by using "double quotes"s and `single quotes's.  If enclosed in 
double quotes, the bodies of the strings are Java string unescaped.  If they 
are enclosed in single quotes, arbitrary characters can be included except for 
the ' character.

+exec+ commands block until they are completed.  +submit+ commands are 
asynchronously sent to the master in order to be executed.  +wait+ are 
essentially joins for recently +submit+ ted commands.

+noop+ :: This command contacts the master and issues a noop (no
operation) command.

+config _logicalnode_ 'source' 'sink'+ :: This command configures a node.  
This is nearly identical to the 'config' command.

+multiconfig '_flumespec_'+ :: This command configures a set of nodes on the 
master using the aggregated format.

+unconfig _logicalnode_+ :: This command changes the configuration of a 
particular node to have a +null+ source and a +null+ state.  +refresh 
_logicalnode_+ :: This command refreshes the current configuration of a 
logical node.  This forces the logicalnode to stop and then restart.  This 
also causes a master re-evaluation that may change the failover lists.

+refreshAll _logicalnode_+ :: This atomically issues a refresh command to all 
of the logical nodes.

+save '_filename_'+ :: This saves the current configuration to the master's 
disk.

+load '_filename_'+ :: This augments the current configuration with the 
logical node specifications found in +_filename_+.

+spawn _physicalnode_ _logicalnode_+:: This creates a new logical node 
_logicalnode_ on physical node +_physicalnode_+.  The node starts with a 
+null+ source and a +null+ sink, and updates its configuration specified at 
the master when it begins heartbeating.  Thus if a logical node configuration 
already exists and a new node is spawned, it will pick up the configuration for 
the logical node.

+decommission _logicalnode_+ :: This removes a logical node from the logical 
node configuration table, and unmaps it from any physical nodes it may be 
installed on.

+unmap _physicalnode_ _logicalnode_+ :: This command breaks the assignment of 
a _logicalnode_ from machine _physicalnode_.  A logical node can be reassigned 
to another physical node using the +spawn+ command.

+unmapAll+ :: This command breaks the assignment of all logical node from 
physical nodes.  A logical node can be reassigned to another physical node 
using the +spawn+ command.
