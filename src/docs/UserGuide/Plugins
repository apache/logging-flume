=== Extending via Sink/Source/Decorator Plugins

An experimental plugin mechanism is provided that allows you to add new custom 
sources, sinks, and decorators to the system.  

.Two steps are required to use this feature.
. First, add the jar with the new plugin classes to flume's classpath.
  If the plugin requires DLL's/so's make sure these are in the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unix .so) or PATH (windows .dll)
. Second, in +flume-site.xml+, add the class names of the new sources,
  sinks, and/or decorators to the +flume.plugin.classes+ property.
  Multiple classes can be specified by comma separating the list. Java
  reflection is used to find some special static methods that add new
  components to the system and data flow language's library.

An example component has been "pluginified" -- the "HelloWorld"
source, sink, and decorator. This plugin does something very simple;
the source generates the text "hello world!" every three seconds, the
sink writes events to a "helloworld.txt" text file, and the decorator
prepends "hello world!" to any event it encounters.

. cd into the +plugins/helloworld+ directory and type +ant+, a +helloworld_plugin.jar+ file will be generated
. Add the following to flume-site.xml (create it if it doesn't already
  exist)
  "helloworld.HelloWorldSink,helloworld.HelloWorldSource,helloworld.HelloWorldDecorator"
  to the +flume.plugin.classes+ property in +flume-site.xml+.
+
IMPORTANT: if you use the provided +flume-site.xml.template+ file to
create your +flume-site.xml+ be sure to comment out or remove any
example properties contained in the sample template.
+
.Example flume-site.xml contents
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>flume.plugin.classes</name>
    <value>helloworld.HelloWorldSink,helloworld.HelloWorldSource,helloworld.HelloWorldDecorator</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of plugins</description>
  </property>
</configuration>
----
. Start the Flume master and at least one logical node in separate terminals
.. in each terminal cd into the top-level flume directory, should be just above +plugins+
.. Add +helloworld_plugin.jar+ to the FLUME_CLASSPATH in *both* terminals
+
----
export FLUME_CLASSPATH=`pwd`/plugins/helloworld/helloworld_plugin.jar
----
.. in terminal 1 run +bin/flume master+
.. in terminal 2 run +bin/flume node -n hello1+
. At this point the master and hello1 nodes should be started and will have loaded the plugin
+
.You should see log output similar to the following in both master and hello1:
----
10/07/29 17:35:28 INFO conf.SourceFactoryImpl: Found source builder helloWorldSource in helloworld.HelloWorldSource
10/07/29 17:35:28 INFO conf.SinkFactoryImpl: Found sink builder helloWorldSink in helloworld.HelloWorldSink
10/07/29 17:35:28 INFO conf.SinkFactoryImpl: Found sink decorator helloWorldDecorator in helloworld.HelloWorldDecorator
----
+
TIP: Another way to verify that your plugin is loaded is to check if it is displayed on this page http://localhost:35871/masterext.jsp
+
. Configure hello1
+
TIP: The easiest way to do this is open the configuration page of the master in a browser, typically this link http://localhost:35871/flumeconfig.jsp
+
.. load the helloworld source/sink into our +hello1+ node (the bottom text box, then submit button if you are using the master's web interface"
+
----
hello1: helloWorldSource() | helloWorldSink();
----
.. you could also try the hello world decorator
+
----
hello1: helloWorldSource() | { helloWorldDecorator() => helloWorldSink() };
----
+
In either case +hello1+ will output a +helloworld.txt+ file into it's current working directory. Every 3 seconds a new "hello world!" line will be output to the file.

==== Semantics of Flume Extensions

Flume uses threading to support reconfiguration and multiple logical
nodes.  Sources, sinks, and decorator are extensions that can use
queues for buffering and can use clock sleeps for periodic rolls and
retries.  Because we use these blocking operations and because the
internal concurrency control mechanisms we use can cause deadlocks or
hangs, there are several rules that need to be followed and enforced
by test cases in order to be a well-behaved source, sink, or
decorator.

NOTE: This section is a draft and not exhaustive or completely formal.
More restrictions may be added to this in the future.

.Semantics  of sources

Sources must implement 4 methods

* void open() throws IOException
* Event next() throws IOException
* void close() throws IOException
* ReportEvent getReport()

Along with these signatures, each of these methods can also throw
RuntimeExceptions.  These exceptions indicate a failure condition and
by default will make a logical node shutdown in ERROR state.  These
error messages are user visible and it is important that they have
actionable descriptions about the failure conditions without having to
dump stack.  Thus, NullPointerExceptions are not acceptable -- they
are not descriptive or helpful without their stack traces.

Some examples of valid runtime exceptions include invalid arguments
that prevent a source from opening and invalid state infractions
(attempting to next on a closed source).

===== Simple source semantics.

["graphviz", "sourceStatesSimple.png"] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
digraph single_collector {   
rankdir=LR;   
START -> CLOSED ;
CLOSED -> OPEN [label="open()"];
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="next() throws Exn"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="next()"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="open() throws Exn"];
OPEN -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple sources are assumed to be sources whose open and close
operation happen quickly and do not block for long periods of time.
The longest pauses tolerated here on the order of 10s (default time
for a failing DNS lookup).

The constructor for the sources should be callable without grabbing
resources that can block or that require IO such as network connectors
or file handles.  If there are errors due to configuration settings
that can be caught in the constructor, an IllegalArgumentException
should be thrown.

+open()+ is a call that grabs resources for the source so that the
+next()+ call can be made.  The +open+ call of a simple source should
attempt to fail fast. It can throw a IOException or a RuntimeException
such as IllegalStateException.  Open should only be called on a CLOSED
sink -- if a sink is opened twice, the second call should throw an
IOException or IllegalStateException.

+next()+ is a call that gets an event from an open source.  If a
source is not open, this should throw an IllegalStateException.  This
call can and will often block. If +next()+ is blocking, a call to
+close()+ should unblock the +next()+ by having it exit cleanly
returning null.  Many resources such as TCP-sockets (and ideally rpc
frameworks) default to throwing an exception on blocked network reads
(like a +next()+ call) when +close()+'d.

+close()+ is a call that releases resources that the open call of a
source grabs.  The +close()+ call itself blocks until all resources
are released.  This allows a subsequent +open()+ in the same thread to
not fail due to resource contention (ex, closing a server socket on
port 12345 should not return until port 12345 is ready to be bound
again).

+getReport()+ returns a ReportEvent.  These values should be available
regardless if the node is open or closed and this call should not
block the other source by other calls (due to potential lock inversion
issues).  The values retrieved are ideally atomically grabbed but this
is not required as long as no errors are caused by racy execution.

If a source is opened or closed multiple times, it is up to the source to
determine if values are reset or persisted between open/close cycles.

===== Buffered source semantics

["graphviz", "sourceStatesBuffered.png"] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
digraph single_collector {   
rankdir=LR;   
START -> CLOSED ;
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="next() throws Exn"];
CLOSED -> OPEN [label="open()"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="next()"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="open() throws Exn"];
OPEN -> CLOSING [label="close()"];
CLOSING-> CLOSING [label="next()"];
CLOSING-> CLOSING [label="close()"];
CLOSING-> CLOSING [label="open() blocks"];
CLOSING-> CLOSED [label="flushed"];
CLOSING-> CLOSED [label="failed"];
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Some sources have in memory queues or buffers stored persistently on
disk.  The guiding principle here is that on +close()+, buffered
sources should prevent new data from entering and attempt to flush the
buffered data.  Also any subordinate threads should be released before
close returns.  If no progress is being made on +close()+, for a given
period of time (30s is the default currently) the controlling thread
will for an Thread.interrupt() call.  The source should be able to
handle InterruptedExceptions and percolate interrupted status up the
returning call stack.

NOTE: In v0.9.1, interruptions when caught should be handled by
re-flagging the Thread's interrupted flag (a call to
+Thread.currentThread().interrupt()+) and then throwing an
IOException.  The API for extensions will likely change in the future
to throw either an IOException or an InterruptedException.

+open()+ no change.

+close()+ This call is usually made from a separate thread than the
open() or next() calls.  Since this call should block until resources
are freed, it should attempt to flush its buffers before returning.
For example, so if a network source has some buffered data, the
network connection should be closed to prevent new data from entering,
and then the buffered data should be flushed.  The source should be
able to handle InterruptedExceptions and percolate interrupted status
up the returning call stack and indicate an error state.

A +next()+ call while in CLOSING state should continue pulling values
out of the buffer until it is empty.  This is especially true if the
next() call is happening in the main driver thread or a subordinate
driver thread.  One mechanism to get this effect is to add a special
DONE event to the queue/buffer that indicates a clean exit.

+getReport()+ ideally includes metric information like the size of the
queues in the source, and the number of elements in the queue.


.Semantics of sinks and decorators

Sinks and decorators must implement 4 methods

* void open() throws IOException
* void append(Event e) throws IOException
* void close() throws IOException
* ReportEvent getReport()

Along with these signatures, each of these methods can also throw
RuntimeExceptions.  Run-time exceptions indicate a failure condition
and by default will make a logical node shutdown in ERROR state.
These error messages are user visible and it is important that they
have helpful descriptions about the failure conditions without having
to dump stack.  Thus, NullPointerExceptions are not acceptable -- they
are not descriptive or helpful without their stack traces.

===== Simple Sinks.

["graphviz", "sinkStatesSimple.png"] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
digraph single_collector {   
rankdir=LR;   
START -> CLOSED ;
CLOSED -> OPEN [label="open()"];
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="append() throws Exn"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="append()"];
OPEN -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="open() throws Exn"];
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple sinks are assumed to have open, close, and append operations
that happen quickly and do not block for long periods of time.  The longest
pauses tolerated here on the order of 10s (default time for a failing
DNS lookup).

The constructor for the sinks and decorators should be callable
without grabbing resources that can block or that require IO such as
network connectors or file handles.  If there are errors due to
configuration settings that can be caught in the constructor, an
IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.

+open()+ is a call that grabs resources for the sink or decorator so
that the +append(Event)+ call can be made.  If there are errors due to
configuration settings not detectable without IO in the constructor,
+open()+ should attempt to fail fast and throw a IOException or
RuntimeException such as IllegalStateException or
IllegalArgumentException.  Open should only be called on a CLOSED sink
-- if a sink is opened twice, the second call should throw an
IOException or IllegalStateException.

+append()+ is a call that delivers a event.  If a sink is not open,
this should throw an IllegalStateException.

If a normal decorator fails to open or to append because of an
internal failure or a subsink fails to open, the decorator should
release its resources attempt to close the subsink and then throw an
exception.  There are some sink/decos that specifically manipulate
these semantics -- this needs to be done with care.

+close()+ is a call that releases resources that the open call of a
source grabs.  If +open()+ or +next()+ is blocking, a call to this
should unblock the call and have them exit.  +close()+ should be
called called on an open sink, but we allow a closed sink to have
+close()+ called on it without throwing an exception (generally LOG
warning however).

+getReport()+ returns a ReportEvent.  These values should be available
regardless if the node is open or closed and this call should not
cause get blocked by other calls (due to potential lock inversion
issues).  The values retrieved are ideally atomically grabbed but this
is not required as long as no errors are caused by racy execution.  If
a sink is opened or closed multiple times, it is up to the sink to
determine if values are reset or persisted between open/close cycles.


===== Buffered sink and decorator semantics

["graphviz", "sinkStatesBuffered.png"] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
digraph single_collector {   
rankdir=LR;   
START -> CLOSED ;
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
CLOSED -> OPEN [label="open()"];
CLOSED -> CLOSED [label="append() throws Exn"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="append()"];
OPEN -> OPEN [label="open() throw Exn"];
OPEN -> CLOSING [label="close()"];
CLOSING -> CLOSING [label="close()"];
CLOSING -> CLOSING [label="open() blocks"];
CLOSING -> CLOSING [label="append() throws Exn"];
CLOSING-> CLOSED [label="success"];
CLOSING-> CLOSED [label="failure"];
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Some sinks have queues or buffers stored in memory or persistently on
disk.  The guiding principle here is that buffered sinks should
attempt to flush its buffers when prompted to +close()+.  This needs
to be balanced with the requirement that sinks and decorated sinks
should attempt to close in a relatively quick fashion.

+open()+ Since this sink isn't open this generally means there is no
buffered data.  However, an +open()+ on a sink or decorator with
persistent data should attempt to recover data and enqueue it in the
+open()+ call. Examples of these include a DFO or WAL log recovering
dfo/wla logs, when a network subsink is down.

An +append()+ call may buffer data before sending it (such as a
batching decorator).  A +close()+ call, should attempt to append
buffered data to its (sub)sink before executing the close. Also, any
subordinate threads should be stopped before shutdown.

If no progress is being made on +close()+, for a given period of time
(30s is the default currently) it will be interrupted and should
handle abruptly exiting because of this interruption.

===== Retries, sleeps, and unclean exits.

digraph single_collector {   
rankdir=LR;

OPEN -> CLOSED [label="close()"];
OPEN -> CLOSED [label="interrupt"];
APPENDING -> CLOSED [label="interrupt"];
} 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Retry on Append semantics

Some decorators introduce retries and sleeps. An author who uses these
needs to ensure that these operations behave well on open, append, and
close.  When combined with buffering sinks, flushing a buffer on close
may not be possible! (ex: wal trying to send data to a dead network
connection).  This means these sinks/decos need a way to exit abruptly
and report an error.  There are two operations that make these cases
 need to be handled: unbounded retries and unbounded/long
sleeps/await/blocking.
 
Some decorators have potentially unbounded retry semantics.  For
example, InsistentOpen, InsistentAppend, and FailoverSinks have the
potential to retry +open()+ and +append()+ calls an unbounded number
of times.  These decorators can also be wrapped with in others -- this
means we need to be able to percolate the hard exit and bypass the
retry logic.

To do this we require that any sink/deco that has retry logic must
check for hard exit before retrying.  These sinks must to propagate
the hard exit interruption to its upstream decorators (in case they
have retry logic!).

Some sinks have the potential to backoff or sleep for long or
potentially unbounded amounts of time.  Code using sleeps or
synchronization operations such as waiting on latches
(+CountDownLatch.await()+) or thread sleeps (+Thread.sleep()+) must
properly handle interruptions.  Since these yielding operations are
usually only used in retry operations (which meant there was a
failure), the sink/deco needs to propagate the interruption and fail
with error.

There are some ramifications of these semantics.  Care must be taken
with locking open, close, and append operations.  If there are any
sleeps or blocking +open()+ operations (ex: InisistentOpen,
FailoverSinks), ideally a close call will cause it to shutdown, it and
the open call should get unblocked.  +append()+

The sink signaled to be closed but blocked on +append()+ or +open()+
should exit in a reasonable amount of time -- ideally within a few
heartbeats (5s is the default, so ideally <30s).  If the sink exits
and its buffers are empty, it should do a normal successful return.
If there were unflushed events, it should return error by throwing an
exception.  If there are subordinate threads, these should be
terminated before close returns.

HIDDEN FOR NOW, THIS IS HALF BAKED

=== Ganglia Reporting

First we need two nodes -- in this example they are run on the same machine.  

----
Terminal 1: $ bin/flume node 

Terminal 2: $ bin/flume node -n localhost
----

We assume the node is called _host_.

Next let's map a new logical node called _report_ to localhost.

----
map localhost report
----

Finally lets set the configuration of the three nodes (replacing _host_ with 
the actual host name).

----
host : asciisynth(0,100) | { delay(250) => agentSink } ;
report : reportPoller | [ console, 
dganglia("LogicalNodeManager._node_.LogicalNode.Agent.NaiveFileWAL.appendSucce
ss", "msgs", "long") ];
localhost : collectorSource | collectorSink("file:///tmp/test/%H","blah",5000);
----

This setup synthesize random ascii data events, and sends one event 250s 
through the agentSink pipeline.  These are received by the +localhost+ node 
which write data into hourly directories.  Meanwhile, the +report+ node on 
+_host_+ is a separate logical node that periodically polls the physical node 
for reports and sends them to the console and a +dganglia+ sink.  The 
+dganglia+ sends the deltas (rate information) between particular values to 
the ganglia gmond daemon.
