=== Extending via Sink/Source/Decorator Plugins

An experimental plugin mechanism is provided that allows you to add new custom 
sources, sinks, and decorators to the system.  

.Two steps are required to use this feature.
. First, add the jar with the new plugin classes to flume's classpath.
  If the plugin requires dlls/so's make sure these are in the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unix .so) or PATH (windows .dll)
. Second, in +flume-site.xml+, add the class names of the new sources,
  sinks, and/or decorators to the +flume.plugin.classes+ property.
  Multiple classes can be specified by comma separating the list. Java
  reflection is used to find some special static methods that add new
  components to the system and data flow language's library.

An example component has been "pluginified" -- the "HelloWorld"
source, sink, and decorator. This plugin does something very simple;
the source generates the text "hello world!" every three seconds, the
sink writes events to a "helloworld.txt" text file, and the decorator
prepends "hello world!" to any event it encounters.

. cd into the +plugins/helloworld+ directory and type +ant+, a +helloworld_plugin.jar+ file will be generated
. Add the following to flume-site.xml (create it if it doesn't already
  exist)
  "helloworld.HelloWorldSink,helloworld.HelloWorldSource,helloworld.HelloWorldDecorator"
  to the +flume.plugin.classes+ property in +flume-site.xml+.
+
IMPORTANT: if you use the provided +flume-site.xml.template+ file to
create your +flume-site.xml+ be sure to comment out or remove any
example properties contained in the sample template.
+
.Example flume-site.xml contents
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>flume.plugin.classes</name>
    <value>helloworld.HelloWorldSink,helloworld.HelloWorldSource,helloworld.HelloWorldDecorator</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of plugins</description>
  </property>
</configuration>
----
. Start the Flume master and at least one logical node in separate terminals
.. in each terminal cd into the toplevel flume directory, should be just above +plugins+
.. Add +helloworld_plugin.jar+ to the FLUME_CLASSPATH in *both* terminals
+
----
export FLUME_CLASSPATH=`pwd`/plugins/helloworld/helloworld_plugin.jar
----
.. in terminal 1 run +bin/flume master+
.. in terminal 2 run +bin/flume node -n hello1+
. At this point the master and hello1 nodes should be started and will have loaded the plugin
+
.You should see log output similar to the following in both master and hello1:
----
10/07/29 17:35:28 INFO conf.SourceFactoryImpl: Found source builder helloWorldSource in helloworld.HelloWorldSource
10/07/29 17:35:28 INFO conf.SinkFactoryImpl: Found sink builder helloWorldSink in helloworld.HelloWorldSink
10/07/29 17:35:28 INFO conf.SinkFactoryImpl: Found sink decorator helloWorldDecorator in helloworld.HelloWorldDecorator
----
+
TIP: Another way to verify that your plugin is loaded is to check if it is displayed on this page http://localhost:35871/masterext.jsp
+
. Configure hello1
+
TIP: The easiest way to do this is open the configuration page of the master in a browser, typically this link http://localhost:35871/flumeconfig.jsp
+
.. load the helloworld source/sink into our +hello1+ node (the bottom text box, then submit button if you are using the master's web interface"
+
----
hello1: helloWorldSource() | helloWorldSink();
----
.. you could also try the hello world decorator
+
----
hello1: helloWorldSource() | { helloWorldDecorator() => helloWorldSink() };
----
+
In either case +hello1+ will output a +helloworld.txt+ file into it's current working directory. Every 3 seconds a new "hello world!" line will be output to the file.


// NOTE: If you want more information about writing your own plugins,

HIDDEN FOR NOW, THIS IS HALF BAKED

=== Ganglia Reporting

First we need two nodes -- in this example they are run on the same machine.  

----
Terminal 1: $ bin/flume node 

Terminal 2: $ bin/flume node -n localhost
----

We assume the node is called _host_.

Next let's map a new logical node called _report_ to localhost.

----
map localhost report
----

Finally lets set the configuration of the three nodes (replacing _host_ with 
the actual host name).

----
host : asciisynth(0,100) | { delay(250) => agentSink } ;
report : reportPoller | [ console, 
dganglia("LogicalNodeManager._node_.LogicalNode.Agent.NaiveFileWAL.appendSucce
ss", "msgs", "long") ];
localhost : collectorSource | collectorSink("file:///tmp/test/%H","blah",5000);
----

This setup synthesize random ascii data events, and sends one evert 250s 
through the agentSink pipeline.  These are received by the +localhost+ node 
which write data into hourly directories.  Meanwhile, the +report+ node on 
+_host_+ is a separate logical node that periodically polls the physical node 
for reports and sends them to the console and a +dganglia+ sink.  The 
+dganglia+ sends the deltas (rate information) between particular values to 
the ganglia gmond daemon.


==== Experimental Sources and Sinks

.Flume's Plugin Sources [horizontal] +amqpPoll(_..._)+ :: AMPQ (Advanced 
Message Queuing Protocol) based on polling

+amqpSub(_..._)+ :: AMPQ (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) based on 
subscribing

+pcapfile("_pcap file_")+ :: One shot pcap file source (packet capture ala 
wireshark).  One packet is one event

+pcap("_filterspec_")+ :: Live filtered pcap source (package capture ala 
wireshark).  One packet is one event.

.Flume's Plugin Sinks

+ampq()+ :: AMQP sink.  Write to specified AMQP broker (this is not present.)

NOTE: Graphing currently uses Google charts API and requires the browser to 
external network connectivity

.Flume's Reporter Sinks (Experimental):
[horizontal]
+ganglia("_attr_","_units_","_type_"[,"_gmondservers_"])+ :: This sink reads 
absolute value of the attribute +_attr_+ as a type +_type_+ where +_type_+ may 
be +int+, +long+, +double+ or +string+.  One may optionally specify a list of 
gmond servers to send metric data to.

+dganglia("_attr_","_units_","_type_"[,"_gmondservers_"])+ :: This sink reads 
the attribute +_attr_+ as a type +_type_+ where +_type_+ may be +int+, +long+, 
or +double+ and then emits the delta of the previous value.  One may 
optionally specify a list of gmond servers to send metric data to.

+counter("_name_")+ :: counts number of events received, and registers report 
to report manager as +_name_+.

+counterHistory("name", .... )+ :: generates historical count versus time 
graph

+multigrep(...)+ :: makes histogram that counts number of events that matches 
substring grep

+multigrepspec(...)+ :: makes histogram that counts number of events that 
match substring grep (uses config file instead of inline)|

+regexhisto(...)+ :: uses regex and builds histogram based on matching group's 
value

+regexhisto(...)+ :: uses regex and builds histogram based on matching group's 
value (uses config file instead of inline)

.Flume's Experimental/Debugging Sink Decorators (unsupported)
[horizontal] 
+flakeyAppend(_p_)+ :: each append has a probability +_p_+ (where 0.0 &le; _p_ 
&le; 1.0) of failing and throwing an exception.

+intervalFlakeyAppend(_n_)+ :: every +_n_+ th element fails by throwing an 
exception

+intervalDroppyAppend(_n_)+ :: every +_n_+ th element fails by throwing an 
exception

+inmem+ :: buffers events in memory and then flushes all on close. Good for 
benchmarking.

+benchinject+ :: injects an extra benchmark begin event on open and a 
benchmark end event on close

+benchreport("_name_")+ :: starts a benchmark when it receives a benchmark 
begin event and stops a benchmark when it receives a corresponding benchmark 
end event.  Benchmark events are not forwarded, but all other events are.

+mult(_n_)+ :: takes each event and sends it _n_ copies of it before sending 
the next event.

// unused, easier to just remove.
// +latch(...)+ :: (Unsupported) adds a latch that blocks until
// triggered.  This is only really useful for debugging and test cases.

===== Deprecated 

.Flume's Deprecated Sources

These sources are "too specific" or perform poorly and are thus deprecated 
(but still available).  They will likely be replaced with a more generic 
mechanisms (similar to the output format mechanism).

.Flume's Experimental Sources

[horizontal]
+tpriosource(_port_)+ :: Thrift RPC base source on TCP port, port,
prioritized by priority (higher priority first) and then age (older 
messages first)

+tsource(_port_)+ :: Same as RPC but specifically thrift RPC

.Flume's Deprecated Sinks

Many of these sinks are left over from earlier iterations.

[horizontal]
+tsink+ :: 

+tacksink(...)+ :: thrift acked sink

+trawsink(...)+ :: thrift using writable serialization instead of thrift 
serialization
