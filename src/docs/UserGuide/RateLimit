=== Limiting Data Transfer Rate between Source-Sink pairs
WARNING: This feature is only available when using the memory-backed store and not the zookeeper-backed store.

Flume has the ability to limit the rate of transfer of data between source-sink pairs.  
This is useful to divide the network bandwidth non-uniformly among different 
source-sink pairs based on the kind of logs they are transferring.  
For example, you can ship some types of logs at a faster rate than others, or you can transfer logs at different rates at different times of the day. 


Another example of when it is beneficial to limit the rate of data transfer is when the network (or a collector) recovers after a failure.  
In this case, the agents might have a lot of data backed up to ship; if there is no limit on the transfer rate, 
the agents can exhaust all of the resources of the collector and possibly cause it to crash.  


In Flume, you can use a special sink-decorator called the +choke+ decorator to limit the rate of transfer of data between source-sink pairs.
Each +choke+ decorator (called a +choke+) has to be assigned to a +choke-id+.  
Here is an example of using a +choke+ between a source and sink of a node; the +choke-id+ of this +choke+ is "Cid".
----
node: source | { choke("Cid") => sink };
----

The +choke-ids+ are specific to a physical node. Before using a +choke+ on +node+, 
you must register the +choke-id+ on the physical node containing the +node+.  
You can register a +choke-id+ on a physical node using the +setChokeLimit+ command.  
When registering a +choke-id+, you must also assign a rate limit (in KB/sec) to it.  
Here is an example of registering a +choke-id+ "Cid" on a physical node +host+ and assigning a limit 1000 KB/sec.
----
exec setChokeLimit host Cid 1000
----

NOTE: You can also use setChokeLimit at the run-time to change the limit assigned to a +choke-id+. 

The limit on the +choke-id+ specifies an upper bound on the rate at which the +chokes+ using that +choke-id+ can collectively transfer data.  
In the preceding example, there is only one source-sink pair on the physical node +host+ that uses a +choke+ with +choke-id+ "Cid". Consequently, the rate of data transfer between that source-sink pair is limited to 1000 KB/sec. 

NOTE: For the purpose of rate limiting, only the size of the event body is taken into account. 

The +choke+ decorator works as follows: when +append()+ is called on the sink to which the +choke+ 
is attached, the +append()+ call works normally if the amount of data transferred 
(during a small duration of time) is within the limit assigned to the +choke-id+ corresponding to the +choke+.
If the limit has been exceeded, then +append()+ is blocked for a small duration of time.

Suppose there are multiple source-sink pairs using +chokes+ between them, and they are using 
the same +choke-id+.  Suppose further that both +node1+ and +node2+ are logical nodes on the same physical node +host+, 
and a +choke-id+ "Cid" with limit 1000KB/sec is registered on +host+.

----
node1: source1 | { choke("Cid") => sink1 };
node2: source2 | { choke("Cid") => sink2 };
----
In this example, because both +source1-sink1+ and +source2-sink2+ pairs are using +chokes+ with the same +choke-id+ "Cid", the total data going across these source-sink pairs collectively is limited to 1000KB/sec. 
Flume does not control how this limit will be divided between the source-sink pairs, 
but it does guarantee that neither source-sink pair will starve.

NOTE: If multiple source-sink pairs on the same physical node use chokes that have the same choke-id, 
then there is no guarantee how the rate limit will be divided between these source-sink pairs.
