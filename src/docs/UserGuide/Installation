[[Installation]]
== Installation

There are currently three packaging options available for installing Flume: a tarball (TGZ), a RPM
and a DEB file. The only prerequisite to running Flume is Java 1.6.

.Installation Prerequisites
****
* A Unix-like system (tested on Centos 5.3+ and Ubuntu 9.04+, Mac OS X)
* Java 1.6.x (only tested with Sun JRE/JDK 1.6)
****

=== Installation by Tarball (TGZ)

The tarball is a self-contained package containing everything needed
 to do get Flume up and running on a Unix-like system.  Installing
 from the tarball is as easy as unpacking it in an appropriate
 directory. For instance on most Linux based systems this can be
 achieved by typing:

----
$ (cd /usr/local/ && sudo tar -zxvf <path_to_flume.tgz> )
----

To complete the configuration of a tarball-based installation, you need to set the environment variable +$FLUME_CONF_DIR+ to be the +conf/+ subdirectory of the location that you installed Flume into - e.g.

----
$ export FLUME_CONF_DIR=/usr/local/flume/conf
----

//If a user is running older bin tools you can achieve the same objective by typing:
//----
//$ ( cd /opt && mkdir flume && cd flume && gzip -cd  <path_to_flume.tgz> | tar -xvf - )
//----

The tarball does not come with any scripts suitable for running Flume
as a service or daemon. This makes the tarball distribution
appropriate for ad-hoc installations and preliminary testing, but a
more complete installation is provided by the binary packages.

=== RPM or Deb Based install
The RPMs and DEBs are much more convenient than a tarball based install in that they:

* Handle dependencies
* Provide for easy upgrades
* Automatically install resources to conventional locations
* Handle daemon startup and shutdown

Both the RPMs and DEBs are broken up into three packages

* +flume-core+ (Everything you need to run Flume)
* +flume-master+ (Handles starting and stopping the Flume master as a service)
* +flume-node+ (Handles starting and stopping the Flume node as a service)

All Flume installations require the common code provided by +flume-core+. To install on a Debian-package compatible system:
----
$ sudo dpkg --install <path to flume core deb>
----

or with +apt-get+:
----
$ sudo apt-get install <path to flume core deb>
----

At this point, you should have everything necessary to run Flume, and the +flume+ command should be in your +$PATH+. You can test this by running:

----
$ flume
----
You should see something like
----
usage: flume command [args...]
commands include: 
  dump            Takes a specified source and dumps to console
  node            Start a Flume node/agent (with watchdog)
  master          Start a Flume Master server (with watchdog)
  version         Dump flume build version information 
  node_nowatch    Start a flume node/agent (no watchdog)
  master_nowatch  Start a Flume Master server (no watchdog)
  class <class>   Run specified fully qualified class using Flume environment (no watchdog)
                   ex: flume com.cloudera.flume.agent.FlumeNode 
  shell           Start the flume shell
  killmaster      Kill a running master
----

.Can't find Flume?
**************************
If +flume+ is not found, and you installed from from a tarball, make sure that +$FLUME_HOME/bin+ is in your $PATH.
**************************

The final step in a package based install is to automatically start
Flume via system runtime levels. The +flume-node+ and +flume-master+
packages make this easy.  

==== Starting Nodes Automatically

On DEB based systems:
----
$ sudo dpkg --install <path to flume node deb>
----
or with +apt-get+:
----
$ sudo apt-get install <path to flume node deb>
----

On RPM based systems:
----
$ sudo rpm --install <path to flume node rpm>
----

==== Starting the Flume Master Automatically
----
$ sudo dpkg --install <path to flume master deb>
----
or with +apt-get+:
----
$ sudo apt-get install <path to flume master deb>
----

On RPM based systems:
----
$ sudo rpm --install <path to flume master rpm>
----

=== Running Flume
Once flume is installed via a RPM or DEB you can start, stop or restart either the Flume Master or the Flume node via init scripts with the following commands:

To control the Flume Master simply type:
----
$ /etc/init.d/flume-master <start | stop | restart >
----

To control the Flume node:
----
$ /etc/init.d/flume-node <start | stop | restart >
----

The node and master can also be run in the foreground directly with any of the installation methods with the +flume+ command. 

To start the Flume node simply type:

----
$ flume node 
----

Or to start the Flume master simply type:
----
$ flume master
----

.Can I run master and node on the same machine?
*****************
When using Flume for the first time, it's common to try running both master and node on the same machine. This should work without a problem - both node and master can share the same configuration files and should not conflict on any ports they open. See the Pseudo-Distributed Mode section for more details.
