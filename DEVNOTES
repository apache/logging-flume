== Introduction 

This is meant to be a a guide for issues that occur when building,
debugging and setting up flume as developer.

== High level directory and file structure.

----
./bin/                  flume scripts
./conf/                 flume configuration files
./lib/                  libraries used by flume
./libbuild/             libraries used by flume for building
./libtest/              libraries used by flume for testing
./src/ahocorasick       a library for multple string search
./src/antlr             flume config language ANTLR grammer files
./src/gen-java          autogenrated java source files (from antlr/thrift)
./src/java              flume java source code
./src/javaperf          flume performance tests (out of date)
./src/javatest          flume unit tests
./src/javatest-torture  flume reliability tests (out of date)
./src/thrift            flume thrift idl files (for rpc)
./src/webapps           flume webapp jsp source code
----

Files created by build:
----
./build
----

== Files in `.gitignore` 

The exclusions in .gitignore are either autogenerated or build/eclipse
specific

== eclipse project setup.

Run "ant eclipse", then create a new java project in eclipse with the
current directory as the base project directory.

----
./.eclipse              default working directory for eclipse
----

Note: eclipse class files are not used by bin/flume, you must either
a) compile via ant for bin/flume to pick up your modified code, or b)
specify eclipse on the flume classpath, e.g.:

FLUME_CLASSPATH=./.eclipse/classes-main:./.eclipse/classes-test bin/flume

== Building thrift

This will create a repository in ./apache-thrift
----
git clone git://git.apache.org/thrift.git
cd thrift
git fetch
git checkout -b thrift-0.2.0 origin/tags/thrift-0.2.0
bootstrap.sh
configure
make
sudo make install
----

Problem: During bootstrap.sh
----
configure.ac:44: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
----
Solution: install libtool
----
sudo apt-get install libtool
----

== Generated source

These files should not be checked in unless their source files are modified.  

For ANTLR
----
src/gen-java/com/cloudera/flume/conf/FlumeDeployLexer.java
src/gen-java/com/cloudera/flume/conf/FlumeDeployParser.java
----

== Running test with ant.

----
ant test
----

=== Running only specified test cases from ant

----
ant test -Dtestcase=<TestFile>
----

where <TestFile> is  a class name without .java or .class or path.

(How do is specify just a function?)

== origin/master invariants

Always should build. 

Ideally tests all pass

== Push invariants

We should tag pushes with JIRA nubmers.

== Flume's web application


The default setup for flume is to run its servlets from precompiled
jsps.  The default configuration points jetty (a jsp server) to
information found in the ./webapps directory.  We assume that most
developers and users will be in core, so at the git project root dir,
./webapps is a symlink that points to the build/webapps directory.
This is where static files and auto-generated files that are generated when
flume is compiled.  Using this symlink makes the flume webapp use
precompiled jsp pages.

One can debug the jsp pages or have them autogenerate at runtime
(useful for development) by changing this symlink to point to
src/webapps.  This directory has subapps and jsp source
code. Debugging is easier when it is more dynamic and our servlet
container Jetty can dyamically comile jsp pages to hasten the
debugging process.  

Here are some tips for getting the web apps for Flume Master or Flume
Node running from inside eclipse.

* Make sure `tools.jar` is in your java classpath.  This allows the compiler to be present.
* Ant is used to compile jsps.  Make sure some version of ant-launcher.jar and ant-1.x.x.jar is in your build path. (if you are in eclipse for example)
* The default is to point to a the web app at a precompiled version of of the servlets.  There is a hook in flume-site.xml to point the jetty at a directory full of jsps.  It assumes that hte flume directory is the base for relative paths or can use a fully qualified path 

Alternately, instead of using symlnks, one can set the following
property in the system's flume-site.conf file, like below.

----
  <property>
    <name>flume.webapps.path</name>
    <value>src/webapps</value>
    <description>This is the path use to the web apps that display
    flume node/master data

      Use src webapps for development.
    </description>
  </property>

Make sure that log4j-xxx.jar is in your CLASSPATH.

== Avro.  

Using a post 1.2.0 version that has reflection that supports
Strings, byte[]'s and extracting fields defined in super classes.

requires (in repo):
----
lib/avro-1.2.0-dev.jar      # (trunk hash 8911c848 ; more avro 1.3 than 1.2)
lib/paranamer-1.5.jar       # extra reflection stuff
lib/jackson-core-asl-1.1.1.jar    # json parser    
lib/jackson-mapper-asl-1.1.1.jar  # json parser
----

== Developer mode.

This is an option in the bin/flume for using eclipse built class files
instead of ant built class files.  

in bash one would set FLUME_DEVMODE to true:

----
$ declare -x FLUME_DEVMODE=true
----

It is assumed that the eclipse build path is build_eclipse/.
